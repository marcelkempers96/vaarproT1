# VaarPro Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy VaarPro to Vercel for production use.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Vercel

### Option 1: Deploy from GitHub (Recommended)

1. **Create a GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Create a new repository on GitHub, then:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vaarpro.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with your GitHub account
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `vaarpro` repository
   - Vercel will automatically detect it's a Vite project
   - Click "Deploy"

### Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI

1. **Install Vercel CLI**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**
   - Set up and deploy? `Y`
   - Which scope? Choose your account
   - Link to existing project? `N`
   - Project name: `vaarpro`
   - Directory: `./`
   - Override settings? `N`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables (if needed)

If your app requires environment variables:

1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings → Environment Variables
3. Add any required variables:
   - `VITE_API_URL` (if you have a backend API)
   - `VITE_MAP_API_KEY` (if using a map service that requires a key)

Vercel will automatically detect your project settings:
- **Framework Preset**: Vite
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
